# Tourney

This program emulates a sports tournament. It uses object oriented programming and text files to create this tournament. You can create your own tournament by making a similar text file to the ones that are in the samples folder. NOTE: I did not make the parser but I made everything else.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./madness "name of text file"
